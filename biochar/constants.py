# Lennard-Jones, bond, and angle parameters intentionally live in oplsaa.ff, not
# here. GROMACS resolves them from the #included forcefield by the opls_XXX name in
# GROMACS_OPLS_TYPE_MAP below, so a hand-copied table here would be dead weight that
# can only drift. A previous table did drift: its values were a mix of AMBER and OPLS
# with no single provenance.
#
# The one exception is SUPPLEMENTARY_ANGLE_PARAMS below, and the rule that keeps it
# from becoming that table again is strict: it may hold ONLY combinations stock
# oplsaa.ff does not define. A value that also exists in the forcefield is
# duplication and will drift; a value that exists nowhere else cannot.
# tests/test_opls_type_map.py enforces both halves -- every emitted combination
# resolves, and nothing here shadows a stock entry.

# Mapping from internal generic type names to GROMACS OPLS-AA opls_XXX names.
# Internal names (CA, HA, etc.) are used throughout the biochar generation pipeline.
# At GROMACS export time, these are translated so the topology is compatible with
# the standard oplsaa.ff forcefield shipped with GROMACS.
#
# When the exported .itp #includes a real oplsaa.ff, only the opls_XXX name reaches
# GROMACS -- mass, charge, LJ and bonded parameters are all resolved from the
# forcefield by that name. A name naming the wrong element therefore silently
# simulates the wrong chemistry. Trailing comments quote the type's description in
# oplsaa.ff/atomtypes.atp verbatim; keep them in sync when editing.
# tests/test_opls_type_map.py checks every entry against an installed oplsaa.ff.

# Two entries above are deliberate approximations, not exact matches:
#
#   SS  -> opls_222 is the thioanisole sulfur (Ar-S-CH3). OPLS-AA has no diaryl
#          thioether (Ar-S-Ar) type; opls_222 is the only aryl-attached sulfide S
#          and carries the matching CA-S bond (0.176 nm, "thioanisole" in
#          ffbonded.itp).
#
#          The CA-S bond resolves, but the CA-S-CA angle has no stock angletype
#          -- see SUPPLEMENTARY_ANGLE_PARAMS below, which supplies it.
#
#   NGR -> opls_379 ("CytH+ N3") is a protonated, cationic aromatic ring N.
#          CHOSEN DELIBERATELY, 2026-07-17, and reviewed -- not inherited from
#          whichever branch merged last. Do not "restore" opls_520 on the
#          assumption that this drifted.
#
#          OPLS-AA has no substitutional 3-coordinate aromatic N, so this is an
#          analog either way; a cationic aromatic N is the closer one, because
#          graphitic N carries a formal +1. It previously shared the neutral
#          pyridine N (opls_520) with NPY, which understated exactly that charge
#          -- the reason it moved is the pH work, which makes formal charge real
#          rather than something ChargeAssigner flattened to zero. Element and
#          ring aromaticity are right; the bonded environment is still
#          approximate, and this is not QM-validated. A QM check, or a better
#          analog, would be a legitimate reason to revisit. "It looks like an
#          accident" is not -- it was a decision.

# Angles that stock oplsaa.ff cannot resolve, written inline into [ angles ] so the
# parameters travel with the molecule (the .itp), not with whichever .top includes it.
#
# Keyed by internal atom type, outer two sorted. Values are GROMACS units:
# (theta0_deg, k_kJ/mol/rad^2) -- the same columns as ffbonded.itp [ angletypes ].

# --- Hydrogen-bond-aware clash detection ----------------------------------
# A polar hydrogen sitting close to an O/N acceptor is a hydrogen bond, not a
# steric clash.  The generic 0.75 × vdW-sum floor is 2.04 Å for an O/H pair,
# which lands squarely inside the physical H...A range (~1.6-2.2 Å), so every
# intramolecular H-bond between adjacent -OH groups is otherwise reported as a
# clash.  On high-oxygen chars (O/C >= ~0.2, e.g. 400 °C softwood) such pairs
# are unavoidable and strict validation fails on every seed.
#
# Donor-acceptor pairs that satisfy the angle criterion below are held to this
# reduced floor instead.  It still catches genuine overlap: an H...O contact
# shorter than this is too close even for a low-barrier hydrogen bond.

# rather than the acceptor being jammed into the side of the D-H bond.

# Reporting the unscaled sum made every such message wrong about what it
# expected, even when the bond really was out of range.
#
# Factors are the ratio of the observed length to the single-bond radii sum:
