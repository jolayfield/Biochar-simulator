# Feature: 3D Geometry Embedding and Clash Detection <!-- rq-0f766d5b -->

`CoordinateGenerator` (`src/biochar/pipeline/geometry_3d.py`) turns a bonded molecular graph into 3D
coordinates, and `GeometryValidator` decides whether the result is physically acceptable.

The recurring failure mode in this area is not a wrong coordinate — it is a **validation
threshold that rejects correct structures**. Every threshold below was retuned at least once
because it flagged real chemistry as an error, and the symptom each time was the same: every
point in a parameter sweep degrading to the fallback path while the geometry itself was fine.
The requirements here therefore pin *what must not be called a clash* as tightly as they pin
what must.

## Embedding Path Selection <!-- rq-80b04b19 -->

Two embedding strategies exist, and the choice between them is made by heavy-atom count, not
by user request.

- Molecules of **80 heavy atoms or fewer** embed with RDKit ETKDGv3 (falling back to ETKDGv2)
  followed by MMFF94 relaxation.
- Molecules of **more than 80 heavy atoms** use a 2D-first path: compute the flat aromatic
  layout, promote to 3D at `z = 0`, perturb non-ring atoms slightly in `z` so the force field
  converges, then minimise.

The reason for the split is that ETKDGv3 folds or collapses large flat fused-ring systems.
A large PAH sheet is genuinely planar, and an embedding algorithm that treats it as a flexible
molecule produces a crumpled sheet with irreducible self-clashes.

Force-field iteration count also scales with size: 300 iterations at or below 100 heavy atoms,
400 above 100, and 500 above 300.

Independently of size, a skeleton carrying a **ring-substituting nitrogen** (pyridinic,
pyrrolic, or graphitic) prefers the flat hex-lattice path, because ETKDGv3 buckles the sheet
around the substituted ring atom.

```gherkin
Feature: Select an embedding path that suits the molecule

  @rq-bb1fbb12
  Scenario: A small molecule uses the distance-geometry embedder
    Given a molecule with 80 or fewer heavy atoms
    When coordinates are generated
    Then ETKDG embedding followed by MMFF94 relaxation produces the coordinates

  @rq-265ec385
  Scenario: A large flat sheet uses the 2D-first path
    Given a molecule with more than 80 heavy atoms
    When coordinates are generated
    Then the flat 2D layout is promoted to 3D rather than embedded by ETKDG
    And the resulting sheet is not folded

  @rq-c4e683c4
  Scenario: Embedding retries a bounded number of times
    Given an embedding attempt that fails to produce coordinates
    When the generator retries
    Then it makes at most 3 independent embedding attempts before giving up
```

## Clash Detection <!-- rq-c2463a78 -->

A clash is atom overlap. The generic floor for a contact between atoms `i` and `j` is
**0.75 × (vdW radius i + vdW radius j)** — 2.55 Å for a carbon–carbon pair. A contact is only
reported when it is *meaningfully* below that floor; see the tolerance section.

### Hydrogen bonds are not clashes <!-- rq-00cacb46 -->

The generic 0.75 × vdW floor evaluates to **2.04 Å** for an O/H pair, which sits squarely
inside the physical H···A range of roughly 1.6–2.2 Å. Every intramolecular hydrogen bond
between adjacent hydroxyl groups therefore trips the generic floor. On high-oxygen chars
(O/C ≥ ~0.2, e.g. 400 °C softwood) such pairs are unavoidable, so strict validation failed on
every seed and every sweep point fell back.

A polar hydrogen pointing at an N or O acceptor is held to a reduced floor of
**`HBOND_MIN_H_ACCEPTOR_DISTANCE` = 1.5 Å** instead. The pair qualifies when the donor and
acceptor are both in `HBOND_DONOR_ACCEPTOR_ELEMENTS` (N, O) and the D–H···A angle is at least
**`HBOND_MIN_DHA_ANGLE_DEG` = 90°**.

The 90° gate is deliberately permissive. Real hydrogen bonds are near-linear (typically
> 120°); requiring only 90° asks that the hydrogen point *toward* the acceptor rather than the
acceptor being jammed into the side of the D–H bond. Hydrogen-bonded pairs are **not** excluded
outright — a contact shorter than 1.5 Å is too close even for a low-barrier hydrogen bond and
is still a clash.

```gherkin
Feature: Distinguish hydrogen bonds from steric clashes

  @rq-6b70c04c
  Scenario: An intramolecular hydrogen bond is not reported as a clash
    Given two adjacent hydroxyl groups whose H sits 2.0 Angstrom from the neighbouring O
    And the D-H...A angle is at least 90 degrees
    When geometry validation runs
    Then the contact is not reported as a steric clash

  @rq-6c0f608d
  Scenario: An overlap too short even for a hydrogen bond is still a clash
    Given a donor-acceptor pair whose H...A distance is below 1.5 Angstrom
    When geometry validation runs
    Then the contact is reported as a steric clash

  @rq-a63f775d
  Scenario: A non-polar contact does not get the hydrogen-bond floor
    Given a hydrogen and a carbon at 2.0 Angstrom with no N or O involved
    When geometry validation runs
    Then the contact is judged against the generic vdW floor, not the hydrogen-bond floor

  @rq-51d0fb61
  Scenario: A high-oxygen structure validates without falling back
    Given a structure generated at an O/C ratio of 0.2 or above
    When strict validation runs
    Then hydrogen bonds between adjacent hydroxyls do not force the fallback path
```

### A clash needs to be deeper than embedding noise <!-- rq-56e62d3f -->

Neither floor is meaningful to 0.01 Å. ETKDG embedding and MMFF relaxation leave contacts
scattered by more than that, so a hard `distance < floor` comparison is a knife edge: a contact
a hundredth of an ångström inside the floor gets reported as a clash.

A contact is a clash only when it is more than **`CLASH_SEVERITY_TOLERANCE` = 0.05 Å** below
its applicable floor. That value is well below genuine overlap — the real clashes this system
exists to catch (two functional groups embedded on top of each other) sit 0.2–0.5 Å inside the
floor. Anything within 0.05 Å is embedding noise, and GROMACS energy minimisation would move
the atom in its first step.

```gherkin
Feature: Tolerate knife-edge contacts that are embedding noise

  @rq-21834b0c
  Scenario: A contact marginally inside the floor is not a clash
    Given a contact 0.01 Angstrom below its applicable clash floor
    When geometry validation runs
    Then it is not reported as a clash

  @rq-b6b192ce
  Scenario: A genuine overlap is still reported
    Given a contact 0.3 Angstrom below its applicable clash floor
    When geometry validation runs
    Then it is reported as a clash with its severity

  @rq-92fec87b
  Scenario: Severity is reported so a marginal contact can be told from a real one
    Given any reported clash
    When the validation message is produced
    Then it states how far below the floor the contact sits
```

## Clash Resolution Is Skipped on the Hex-Lattice Path <!-- rq-8e5f5dc1 -->

When `CoordinateGenerator.used_hex_lattice` is true, clash resolution does not run.

Peri-hydrogen contacts in large fused PAHs are real geometry, not errors. They sit inside the
0.75 × vdW threshold by construction, so a resolver would try to displace hundreds of atoms and
shatter the ring lattice — replacing a correct structure with a broken one. The flat hex-lattice
path produces geometrically exact sheets; clash warnings on those structures are artefacts and
GROMACS energy minimisation resolves them.

```gherkin
Feature: Do not resolve clashes on geometrically exact lattices

  @rq-49e2ed82
  Scenario: Hex-lattice structures keep their coordinates
    Given a structure whose coordinates came from the hex-lattice path
    When the generator finishes geometry
    Then clash resolution does not run
    And the ring lattice is left intact

  @rq-3c400653
  Scenario: Small-molecule structures still get clash resolution
    Given a structure embedded by ETKDG rather than the hex lattice
    When the generator finishes geometry
    Then clash resolution runs
```

## Force-Field Refinement Is Not Gated on Clashes <!-- rq-e05e7026 -->

On the non-hex-lattice path every structure goes through force-field refinement, whether or not
clash detection reported anything. Clash *resolution* is conditional — there is nothing to
displace when no contact is flagged — but refinement is unconditional.

A clean clash report does not mean the embedding is strain-free. The two rules look at different
things: clash detection measures non-bonded contacts, and ETKDG can satisfy every one of those
while leaving a compressed aromatic bond of 1.16 Å where 1.40 Å is expected. Only the force-field
pass relaxes that.

Gating refinement on the clash report would make it depend on whichever contacts the clash rules
happen to flag. Such a dependency is invisible while it holds — refinement runs by side effect
for as long as some contact is always reported — and silently stops the moment the clash rules
become more precise. The two passes are therefore kept independent.

```gherkin
Feature: Refine geometry regardless of what clash detection found

  @rq-acf97ed2
  Scenario: A structure with no reported clashes is still refined
    Given a structure embedded off the hex-lattice path
    And geometry validation reports no steric clash
    When the generator finishes geometry
    Then force-field refinement runs

  @rq-5658c4b6
  Scenario: Clash resolution does not run when there is nothing to resolve
    Given a structure embedded off the hex-lattice path
    And geometry validation reports no steric clash
    When the generator finishes geometry
    Then the clash resolver is not invoked
```

## Bond-Length Validation <!-- rq-ff2c049b -->

`COVALENT_RADII` are single-bond radii, so their sum predicts a single bond only. The expected
length is scaled by bond order through `BOND_ORDER_LENGTH_FACTORS`: single 1.00, aromatic 0.92,
double 0.87, triple 0.79. An aromatic C–C is 1.40 Å, not the 1.52 Å the unscaled radii sum
implies; a C=O is 1.23 Å, not 1.42 Å.

Before this scaling every out-of-range message stated the wrong expectation, even when the bond
really was out of range — a diagnostic that misleads is worse than no diagnostic.

The accepted band is **`BOND_LENGTH_MIN_FACTOR` = 0.85** to **`BOND_LENGTH_MAX_FACTOR` = 1.40**
of the scaled expectation. These are tighter than the previous 0.8/1.5 band on purpose:
correcting the expectation downward for aromatic and multiple bonds would otherwise lower the
absolute floor and let a genuinely compressed bond through.

```gherkin
Feature: Judge bond length against the bond order actually present

  @rq-9a9488ab
  Scenario: An aromatic C-C is measured against the aromatic expectation
    Given an aromatic carbon-carbon bond of 1.40 Angstrom
    When bond-length validation runs
    Then the bond is accepted
    And the expected length reported is the aromatic value, not the single-bond radii sum

  @rq-64623ade
  Scenario: A carbonyl is measured against the double-bond expectation
    Given a C=O bond of 1.23 Angstrom
    When bond-length validation runs
    Then the bond is accepted

  @rq-50d3a0c4
  Scenario: A compressed bond is still rejected after order scaling
    Given a bond shorter than 0.85 times its order-scaled expected length
    When bond-length validation runs
    Then the bond is reported as out of range
```

## Every Geometry Error Is Reported <!-- rq-2ceb3ae6 -->

A structure report names every geometry error found, not a sample of them.

Completeness is what makes the report a diagnostic. Reporting a fixed-size prefix of the error
list biases it toward whichever check runs first: a sheet carrying one out-of-range bond and a
long tail of clash contacts shows the contacts and drops the bond, and the one error worth acting
on is the one that never appears. A caller that wants a summary can truncate a complete list;
a caller given a truncated list cannot recover what was dropped.

```gherkin
Feature: Report every geometry error, not a sample

  @rq-1f2ce9fc
  Scenario: A structure with more than three geometry errors reports all of them
    Given a structure whose geometry validation finds more than three errors
    When the structure report is produced
    Then the report contains every one of those errors
```

## Validation Does Not Rewrite What It Validates <!-- rq-0066e1ac -->

Structure validation is a read. The molecule that comes out of it is the molecule that went in.

The check that made this worth stating is `ChemicalFeasibilityValidator`'s connectivity test,
which asks RDKit to sanitise the molecule and records a warning if that raises. Sanitisation is
not a read: it kekulises, and kekulisation of a fused-ring sheet that has no kekulé structure
rewrites aromatic bonds to single on its way to raising. Run against the caller's own molecule,
the question answered itself and destroyed the subject in the same call.

What came back was worse than either state — atoms still flagged aromatic, every bond single —
and nothing downstream re-perceives the molecule, so that inconsistency is what was written to
the topology. The valence check in the same validator runs *before* the sanitisation, so the
report said the structure was fine while handing back one that was not.

Sanitising a copy answers the same question about the same graph.

```gherkin
Feature: Leave the molecule as it was found

  @rq-75c9724b
  Scenario: Validating a molecule that will not kekulise leaves its bonds alone
    Given a fused-ring molecule RDKit cannot kekulise
    When chemical feasibility validation runs on it
    Then its bond types and aromatic flags are unchanged

  @rq-8ebaed02
  Scenario: A molecule RDKit rejects is still reported
    Given a molecule whose sanitisation raises
    When chemical feasibility validation runs on it
    Then the report carries a sanitisation warning
```

## A Molecule Leaves Embedding Preparation Knowing Its Rings <!-- rq-07eab6b8 -->

The step that kekulises a molecule for embedding — or strips its aromaticity when the graph will
not kekulise — returns it with its ring information available, on both paths.

The de-aromatising path sanitises, and sanitisation is allowed to fail: a biochar graph carrying
one bad valence is still a graph the force field can be handed, so the failure is swallowed and
the geometry goes ahead. But `SanitizeMol` clears the molecule's computed properties, ring
information among them, before it does any of its work. A sanitisation that raises partway
therefore hands back a molecule that knows *less* about itself than the one that went in, and
every later question of the form "is this atom in a ring?" raises `RingInfo not initialized`
rather than answering.

Nothing near the failure notices. The molecule embeds, coordinates come out, and the generation
dies three stages downstream in atom typing — which asks that question of every atom — reporting
a missing-ring-info precondition rather than the valence that actually went wrong. Perceiving the
rings before returning costs nothing and does not sanitise, so it cannot disturb the bond types the
heteroatom stages set.

```gherkin
Feature: Do not hand on a molecule whose rings have been forgotten

  @rq-a157df17
  Scenario: A molecule whose sanitisation failed still knows its rings
    Given a molecule that cannot be kekulised and fails sanitisation
    When it is prepared for embedding
    Then its ring information is available

  @rq-ac433b55
  Scenario: A molecule that kekulises cleanly also knows its rings
    Given a molecule that kekulises
    When it is prepared for embedding
    Then its ring information is available
```

## Embedding Returns the Molecule It Was Given, Carrying the Coordinates It Found <!-- rq-2a552a1a -->

`generate_3d_coordinates` returns the caller's own molecule with a conformer on it. The
bond-order-rewritten copy that embedding and the force fields worked on does not escape.

The copy exists because RDKit's embedders and force fields need integer bond orders, and a large
fused-ring biochar sheet frequently will not kekulise. `_kekulize_or_dearomatize` then strips
**every** aromatic bond to single and clears every aromatic flag — a legitimate scaffold for
computing coordinates, and a molecule that no longer claims a single aromatic ring.

Returning that copy handed the rest of the pipeline a sheet whose chemistry was gone. Valence
validation reported `Valence 3 below minimum 4` for every ring carbon in the molecule at once,
atom typing fell back to its ring-and-degree proxy for aromatic carbon rather than reading the
flag, and aromatic-planarity enforcement found no aromatic ring to enforce anything on. Only the
coordinates were a result; the chemistry was scaffolding.

The refinement pass that runs afterwards, `validate_and_relax`, therefore builds its own
force-field-safe copy instead of parametrising what it is handed. It returns coordinates and
nothing else, so nothing about the caller's molecule needs to survive into it — and MMFF and UFF
would both refuse an aromatic sheet, quietly, leaving the coordinates unrefined and
refined-looking.

```gherkin
Feature: Do not return the scaffold in place of the molecule

  @rq-d5b18b3a
  Scenario: A structure that will not kekulise still comes back aromatic
    Given a fused-ring molecule RDKit cannot kekulise
    When coordinates are generated for it
    Then the returned molecule still has its aromatic bonds and flags

  @rq-79908020
  Scenario: The returned molecule carries the coordinates that were computed
    Given a molecule that embeds successfully
    When coordinates are generated for it
    Then the returned molecule's conformer holds those coordinates

  @rq-592b8c66
  Scenario: Refinement relaxes an aromatic molecule rather than declining it
    Given an aromatic molecule and a set of coordinates
    When force-field refinement runs
    Then the coordinates are changed by the refinement
