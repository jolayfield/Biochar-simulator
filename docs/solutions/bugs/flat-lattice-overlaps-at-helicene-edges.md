# Overlaps on a flat lattice were dismissed as artefacts, and strict mode rejected nearly every large sheet

Issue #62.

## Context

On the hex-lattice path (>80 heavy atoms), ring carbons sit on an exact flat lattice and every
substituent is placed radially outward from its parent. The generic clash resolver is skipped
there, and the codebase's guidance said to ignore clash warnings on these structures: *"peri
contacts are real geometry; GROMACS energy minimisation resolves them."*

## Symptom

With the default `strict=True`, 100-carbon structures failed on **every** seed, whatever the
composition, even with no oxygen at all (`H_C_ratio=0.35, O_C_ratio=0.0`: 6/6 failed).
Temperature mode at 500 °C passed 1 in 6 at 100 C and above.

## What was actually there

Cataloguing every reported contact across 69 structures, and grouping each by how far apart its
two ring anchors are in space and through the graph, gave one family. It is **helicene-type
edges**, which a flat lattice cannot represent:

| Motif | Anchors | What the flat placement produced |
|---|---|---|
| bay (phenanthrene) | 2.84 Å, 3 bonds | H···O ~1.6 Å |
| **cove** ([4]helicene) | 2.46 Å, 4 bonds | substituents 0.1–0.6 Å apart; ring C···C 2.46 Å, inside the 2.50 Å floor |
| fjord ([5]helicene) | 1.42 Å, 5 bonds | substituent 0.1–0.3 Å from the other arm's ring carbon |

The "peri contacts at ~2.44 Å" in the old comment were real, but they weren't what was failing.
The contacts left behind were 6–7× shorter.

GROMACS energy minimisation settled what was physical. It opened each cove from 2.46 Å to
~2.95 Å, took cove H···H from 0.57 Å to 1.95 Å, and buckled ring carbons up to 1.0 Å out of
plane, which is exactly how a real [4]helicene twists. So the ring carbons had to move. Moving
only H and O, as first proposed in #62, could never have passed strict mode.

## Fix

`CoordinateGenerator.relieve_lattice_crowding`, run in `_generate_geometry` on the hex-lattice
branch after embedding and planarity enforcement. It does three things:

1. **Tilt.** Each crowded substituent group turns rigidly out of plane about its ring atom, with
   the two sides of a site going opposite ways.
2. **Tethered relaxation.** A UFF pass on an sp2-typed copy. Ring atoms have flat-bottomed tethers
   (0.3 Å), and aromatic bonds are held to 1.40–1.42 Å.
3. **Guard.** The relaxed result is kept only if it has no more bond errors and no more clashes
   than the tilted one, and it's still flat (ring RMS ≤ 0.75 Å). Otherwise the tilted coordinates
   are kept.

Separately, a polar H is now placed at 108.5° to its bond, not collinear with it.

Results:

- **Temperature grid (500–800 °C, 60–200 C, 6 seeds):** clash failures went from 5–6 of 6 in every
  cell at 100 C and above to **none**.
- **Plain 100 C (H/C 0.35, O/C 0–0.1):** 18/18 pass, against 0/18 before.
- **The same example through GROMACS energy minimisation:** 1,068 steps to 444 kJ/mol, against
  1,337 steps to 620 kJ/mol before.

## Three traps, each of which produced a convincing wrong answer

**1. The stale conformer.** The molecule reaching the relief already carries its embedded
conformer. `AddConformer` appends a second one, and `UFFGetMoleculeForceField` uses the first. The
force field therefore minimised the *raw overlapping* coordinates every time and ignored the input
entirely.

The tell was an energy (1.3 × 10¹⁷) that did not change when atoms were moved by 3 Å. An energy
that doesn't respond to the coordinates you changed is minimising different coordinates.
`RemoveAllConformers()` first.

**2. The collinear hydroxyl.** "Place H opposite the parent's other neighbours" is the C–O axis
itself when the parent has one heavy neighbour. 30% of hydroxyls sat at a 180° C–O–H, the ones no
clash drew attention to, and `_optimize_h_positions` cannot rotate a collinear H. It made UFF's
torsions singular.

Separately, RDKit marks a phenolic O conjugated (sp2), which UFF reads as a carbonyl `O_2`, so the
copy retypes it sp3.

**3. The NaN that validated.** `validate_geometry` returns early on NaN coordinates, reporting only
"NaN values found". A metric that counted *clash* errors therefore scored a NaN structure as
clean. An early version of the tilt produced NaN (a degenerate axis once a group had turned 90°)
and looked like a 35/45 success.

Count every error kind, or check finiteness first.

## Also learned

- **UFF can't take a non-kekulisable aromatic sheet**, and `_kekulize_or_dearomatize` types ring
  carbons sp3, which folds the sheet. Single bonds plus explicit sp2 hybridisation and
  `SetNoImplicit(True)` work. The single-bond rest length (~1.47 Å) then needs a *stiff* distance
  constraint: at k = 500 the bonds settled at 1.46 Å. A relaxed bond sits at the constraint's upper
  edge, so the range should top out at the target (1.40–1.42 Å), not straddle it.
- **A perfectly flat start is a saddle point**, and a minimiser never leaves it. Seed a small
  out-of-plane offset.
- **Force fields don't start from near-coincident atoms.** Without the tilt stage, UFF stretched
  ring bonds to 2–28 Å.
- **Tuning on cached inputs can mislead.** The prototype cleaned several oversized skeletons from a
  cache built before the hydroxyl fix. The same skeletons from the real pipeline, with correct H
  placement, did not relieve. When a result depends on input details, re-capture the input from
  the real pipeline before tuning.

## What this does not fix

- **Oversized skeletons.** Some elongated builds overshoot their carbon target (asked for 200, got
  310) and leave unbonded ring carbons at bond distance (fjords). Relief makes them no worse but
  can't rescue them. That's a skeleton-builder defect.
- **The Kamada–Kawai path.** When H/C-reaching aliphatic carbons are untagged, the sheet takes the
  Kamada–Kawai layout, not the hex lattice, and its residual contacts (≤0.1 Å inside the floor)
  are outside this path.
- **Composition.** 650–800 °C targets below a skeleton's H/C floor are #63.
