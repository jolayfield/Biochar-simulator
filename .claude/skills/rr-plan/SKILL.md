Do not start implementation. Focus only on planning and documentation. Do not write to anything except requirements file(s).

## Right-size the documentation to the change

The default action of this skill is to **modify an existing requirements file**, not
to create a new one. New requirements files exist to describe features that are large
or clearly distinct from anything already documented. Most invocations of this skill
are tweaks, extensions, or behaviour changes to systems that are already described
somewhere under `rqm/` — those go into the existing canonical file.

Use this decision tree:

1. **The change tweaks or extends behaviour described by an existing requirements
   file.** Edit that file in place. Update only the sections affected by the change.
   Match the size of the edit to the size of the change: a one-bullet revision is the
   appropriate response to a one-bullet change. Do not create a new file. Do not author
   a parallel "satellite" file that orbits the existing one.
2. **The change spans multiple existing requirements files.** Edit each affected
   file in place. A new file is appropriate only when the cross-cutting concern
   itself warrants its own canonical reference (rare).
3. **The change introduces a feature that is large and clearly distinct in scope
   from anything described under `rqm/`.** Create a new file. The *Markdown File
   Location*, *Feature API Section*, and *Gherkin Scenarios Section* guidance below
   applies in full to this case.

When in doubt between editing in place and creating a new file, prefer editing in
place. A trivial change should produce a trivial diff.

## Examine the Codebase

Read CLAUDE.md, as well as any architecture or design documents referenced by CLAUDE.md.

Identify whether the requested change is already covered by, partially covered by, or
adjacent to an existing requirements file. The most common outcome is that an
existing file describes the system the change touches even when no existing file is
named after the change itself; finding that file is part of this step. Use this
result with the *Right-size the documentation to the change* decision tree:

- If an existing file already fully describes the requested behaviour, report this
  and stop execution of this skill.
- If an existing file partially describes the behaviour, the change goes in that
  file. Edit it in place.
- If the change is large and clearly distinct from anything described under `rqm/`,
  draft a new requirements file.

Check if other existing requirements files describe adjacent features that may need
to be cross-referenced.

Scan the relevant source directories to understand existing patterns and determine the project's existing language(s). Use the detected language(s) while executing this skill.

## Current-State Framing

Requirements files describe the **current desired state** of the code, not deltas relative
to a prior state. The text should be Markovian: a reader who has never seen prior versions
of the code or this document should be able to read it and understand exactly what the
system should look like, without context about what existed before.

**Avoid** delta language and historical framing:

- "This feature adds…", "This feature delivers…", "This feature ships…"
- "A new field X is added to Y", "Two new variants are appended", "We extend Z with…"
- "The existing W is replaced by…", "We modify…", "We rewrite…"
- Comparisons to prior code versions ("the legacy X", "previously…", "today's behaviour")
- Cross-references that frame other requirements files as superseded or being superseded
- Section titles like "Schema Changes" (just call it "Schema")

**Prefer** flat, declarative descriptions of what the code looks like:

- "X carries field Y", "Type X has variants A, B, C"
- "The system has N components: …"
- "Y is populated from Z at creation time"
- "Field F controls W"
- "Templates use this effect to install …"

This applies to every section: feature description, schema, API, and any cross-references
to other requirements files.

**Migration content** belongs in a requirements file only when implementation of the
feature is expected to deliberately leave certain things unmigrated. This situation
should be avoided wherever possible — aim for hard cutovers that leave the codebase in a
consistent state, not phased migrations that span multiple feature increments. If a
Migration Notes section is genuinely warranted, it must explicitly describe the residual
unmigrated state and justify why that state is intentional. A Migration Notes section
that just lists which call sites the implementation will touch is **not** justified —
that information lives in the implementation PR, not the requirements.

When **modifying an existing requirements file**, rewrite affected sections so the file
continues to describe the current desired state in flat, Markovian terms — do not append
a "the X section is now updated to read…" or "previously X, now Y" delta. The result
should look like a from-scratch description of the current intent.

## Example Requirements Files

A complete example requirements file is available at `.riprap/managed/skills/rr-plan/bse.md`. Read this file.

## Feature Scope

Features should be as small and self-contained as reasonably possible. Consider whether the user's feature idea can be cleanly subdivided into smaller components. If so, use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask the user if it is acceptable to subdivide the feature into multiple smaller requirements files corresponding to each of these natural subdivisions.

## Clarify the Plan

Identify unresolved decisions whose answers would materially change the requirements,
implementation, compatibility, or user-visible behavior.

If any such ambiguity remains, use AskUserQuestion to ask the user before writing the
requirements. Batch related questions and continue until every material decision is resolved or
explicitly deferred.

If the request and existing project context already resolve all material decisions, do not ask
ceremonial questions. Record any non-obvious assumptions in the requirements and proceed.

## Markdown File Location

This section applies when *Right-size the documentation to the change* selected the
new-file path. For in-place edits to existing files, the file's existing location is
the answer.

Place the new requirements markdown file in the `rqm` directory. The file name
should be brief and descriptive of the feature. The file should begin with a clear
description of the feature.

Features that have been subdivided into smaller components may be organized into appropriate subdirectories of `rqm`.

## Feature API Section

A new requirements file describing functions, classes, or types that are expected
to be accessible to other portions of the code must include a Feature API section
indicating the interface and expected behaviour of those items.

In-place edits to existing files extend whatever API section is already present (if
any). Do not introduce a Feature API section solely to document a small behaviour
tweak; the section structure of an in-place edit should match the size and shape of
the change.


For example, a feature that implements a function in Rust might include:

```
## Feature API

### Functions

- `fetch_basis(element: &str, basis_name: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, BseError>`
  - Validates the element symbol against the known periodic table (elements 1–118).
  - Normalizes `basis_name` to lowercase and `element` to title case before use in file paths and
    API requests.
  - Checks whether a valid cached file already exists at `data/basis/{basis_name}/{element}.json`.
  - If the cache is missing or corrupt, downloads the basis set data for the given element from the
    BSE REST API in QCSchema (JSON) format, creating any missing directories, and overwrites the
    cache file with the fresh response.
  - Returns the `PathBuf` to the cached file on success.

### Types

- `BseError` — error type returned by `fetch_basis`. Must include at minimum:
  - `InvalidElement(String)` — the element symbol does not correspond to a known element (Z = 1–118).
  - `InvalidBasisSetName(String)` — the basis set name is empty or otherwise malformed before any
    API request is made.
  - `ElementNotInBasisSet { element: String, basis_name: String }` — the basis set exists but does
    not include data for this element.
  - `UnknownBasisSet(String)` — the BSE does not recognise the basis set name (HTTP 404).
  - `NetworkError(String)` — a network or HTTP-level failure (unreachable host, timeout, or
    non-200/404 status code).
  - `IoError(String)` — a filesystem operation failed (directory creation, file write, or file read).
  - `InvalidResponse(String)` — the BSE returned a response that could not be parsed as valid JSON.
```


## Gherkin Scenarios Section

A new requirements file must include a section for Gherkin Scenarios. These scenarios
should clarify the requirements as well as the proper handling for any edge cases.
Be complete and thorough.

In-place edits to existing requirements files follow the existing file's structure.
If the existing file uses Gherkin scenarios, extend that section to cover the
changed behaviour. If the existing file does not currently use Gherkin scenarios,
do not add one solely because of a small in-place edit.

When the feature is later implemented, these scenarios will be used to construct unit tests, and they should therefore be designed to be suitable for this purpose. It should ideally be straightforward and reasonable to construct a single unit test corresponding to each scenario.

The following provides a subset of the Gherkin scenarios that might be included in the Gherkin Scenarios section:


```gherkin
Feature: Fetch basis set from Basis Set Exchange

  Background:
    Given the BSE base URL is "https://www.basissetexchange.org"

  Scenario: Download a basis set that is not cached
    Given the file "data/basis/sto-3g/H.json" does not exist
    And the BSE API will return a valid QCSchema JSON response for element "H" and basis "sto-3g"
    When fetch_basis("H", "sto-3g") is called
    Then the file "data/basis/sto-3g/H.json" is created
    And the file contains the JSON response returned by the BSE API
    And fetch_basis returns Ok with the path "data/basis/sto-3g/H.json"

  Scenario: Return cached file when a valid cache exists
    Given a non-empty, valid JSON file exists at "data/basis/sto-3g/H.json"
    When fetch_basis("H", "sto-3g") is called
    Then no HTTP request is made to the BSE API
    And fetch_basis returns Ok with the path "data/basis/sto-3g/H.json"

  Scenario: Reject an unrecognised element symbol
    When fetch_basis("Xx", "sto-3g") is called
    Then no HTTP request is made to the BSE API
    And fetch_basis returns Err(BseError::InvalidElement("Xx"))

  Scenario: Basis set name is not known to the BSE
    Given the file "data/basis/unknown-basis/H.json" does not exist
    And the BSE API will return HTTP 404 for element "H" and basis "unknown-basis"
    When fetch_basis("H", "unknown-basis") is called
    Then fetch_basis returns Err(BseError::UnknownBasisSet("unknown-basis"))
    And no file is written to disk
```


## Other Sections

Add any other sections that are useful for specifying the feature requirements. Examples:
Data Model, Performance Constraints, Security Considerations, External API Details,
Out of Scope (deliberate non-goals).

Do **not** include sections that describe transient implementation activity rather than
the current desired state — for example: "Source-Code Rename Targets," "Documentation
Changes" (listing other rqm files that need editing), or "Migration Notes" listing
mechanical call-site updates. That information belongs in the implementation PR's
description, not the requirements file. A Migration Notes section is only appropriate
when the feature deliberately leaves residual state in the codebase that the requirements
file must declare; see *Current-State Framing*.

## Traceability IDs

Every requirements file uses stable opaque IDs (e.g. `rq-3a7f1c2e`) to tag headings, API items,
and Gherkin scenarios. These IDs are managed by `.riprap/managed/skills/rr-plan/rqm.sh`.

**Do not write placeholder IDs.** When drafting new requirements, leave all headings, API items,
and Gherkin scenarios without any `rq-` annotation. Do not use `@rq-PENDING`,
`<!-- rq-PENDING -->`, or any other placeholder form. The `stamp` command assigns real IDs
automatically; placeholder text prevents it from doing so and must be cleaned up manually.

**After writing or modifying any requirements file**, run these two commands in order:

```
.riprap/managed/skills/rr-plan/rqm.sh stamp <path-to-file>
.riprap/managed/skills/rr-plan/rqm.sh index
```

`stamp` assigns fresh IDs to any entities that do not yet have one; it never changes existing IDs.
`index` rebuilds `rqm/registry.json` so that the new or updated entries are recorded.

**When examining existing requirements files or source files**, if you encounter an `rq-XXXXXXXX`
ID and need more context about what it refers to, use:

```
.riprap/managed/skills/rr-plan/rqm.sh show rq-XXXXXXXX
```

This prints the type, file, title, declaration line, and source references for that ID. Use this
whenever you find an `rq-` token in a source file comment and need to understand the requirement it
implements before proposing changes.


## Project-Specific Extensions

Read `.riprap/user/skills/rr-plan/local.md` and follow any instructions it contains. Where those
instructions conflict with the instructions above, `local.md` takes precedence.
