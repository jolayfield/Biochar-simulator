# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Read `AGENTS.md` first.** It holds the working rules that apply to any coding agent — how requirements
move with the code, which green runs are not evidence, and the force-field rules. This file adds the
Claude-Code-specific configuration and the architecture reference; it does not repeat `AGENTS.md`.

## Project knowledge

- `rqm/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design overview and the index of the requirements set. **Read this
  first** when orienting to the codebase.
- `rqm/*.md` — feature requirements with Gherkin scenarios. Each heading and scenario carries a stable
  `rq-XXXXXXXX` ID; tests reference those IDs in comments, and `rqm/registry.json` maps them both ways.
  These are **prospective** — the behaviour we promise. When changing behaviour in a specified area,
  update the requirement in the same change, then `bash tools/rqm/rq index`.
- `docs/solutions/` — documented solutions to past problems (bugs, conventions, patterns), organized by
  category with YAML frontmatter (`module`, `tags`, `problem_type`). These are **retrospective** — what
  we learned. Relevant when implementing or debugging in a documented area.
- `docs/reviews/` — dated, commit-pinned assessments of the codebase. **Point-in-time**: what was
  true at one commit, not a plan and not scheduled. Re-verify before acting on a finding.
- `CONCEPTS.md` — shared domain vocabulary. Relevant when orienting to the codebase or discussing domain
  concepts.

`rqm/` and `docs/solutions/` are complements, not duplicates: one states the invariant, the other records
how it was learned. A fix usually earns an entry in both.

```bash
bash tools/rqm/rq check          # which requirements no test defends
bash tools/rqm/rq show rq-xxxxxxxx   # one requirement and everything referencing it
```

Not every module is specified yet — `rqm/ARCHITECTURE.md` lists what is covered and what is not. An
unspecified module is not unverified; it means its tests answer to no written requirement.

## Commands

```bash
# Install from conda-forge (recommended)
conda install -c conda-forge biochar

# or from PyPI
pip install biochar

# Development install (editable, with extras)
pip install -e ".[dev,viz]"

# Install the pre-commit gate (once per clone)
bash tools/hooks/install.sh

# Fast tier -- ~30s. Always pass -n auto; serially this is minutes.
python -m pytest -m "not slow" -n auto

# Full suite, including the slow regressions -- ~1m25s under -n auto.
python -m pytest -n auto

# Run a single test
python -m pytest tests/test_generator.py::TestCarbonSkeleton::test_pah_assembler_benzene -v

# PAH quality suite (not pytest — run directly)
python tests/test_pah_quality.py

# Build docs
cd docs && make html
```

The test discovery root is `tests/` (configured in `pyproject.toml`), which holds 40 files.

**The suite has two tiers.** 15 of 1064 tests account for most of the runtime — end-to-end regressions
that generate real structures across several seeds. They carry the `slow` marker so the tier you run
constantly stays fast. Measured 2026-08-04 at `27b8244` on 14 workers, three runs each within 0.5s: the
fast tier is **1049 tests in ~30s**, the full suite **1064 in ~1m25s**. When adding a test that takes
more than a few seconds, mark the individual case `slow`, not its whole class — a class-level marker
exiles its fast siblings from the pre-commit tier.

**Both figures assume `-n auto`, and the difference is the whole point.** Serial numbers for this suite
have been quoted before without saying they were serial — an earlier "~22 minutes for everything" was
one, and it is roughly fifteen times the parallel figure. It made the full suite look like something to
route around when it costs a minute and a half. Always pass `-n auto`, and when recording a timing here,
say which one it is.

**The full-suite figure depends on how xdist distributes, not only on how much work there is.**
`pyproject.toml` sets `addopts = "--dist worksteal"`; without it the same suite takes 3m30s. The default
`--dist load` hands each worker a chunk up front, so the 43-second regressions bunch onto a few workers
and serialise there while the rest idle. The arithmetic is the tell: the fast tier alone is ~30s and the
slow tier alone is ~49s, and any full-suite figure much above their sum is a scheduling artefact rather
than work. If the full suite ever reads slower than about a minute and a half again, check that the flag
is still in effect before assuming a test got heavier.

**A run that skips more than once verified less than it appears to.** With GROMACS and MOPAC on `PATH`
the expected result is exactly **1 skip** — `test_grompp_smoke.py`'s deliberate case, which requires
`gmx` to be *absent*. Anything higher means the forcefield or QM-charge tests opted out silently. The
usual cause is `export GMXDATA="$CONDA_PREFIX/share/gromacs"` in a non-interactive shell, where
`CONDA_PREFIX` is empty, so it expands to `/share/gromacs` and does nothing. Write the path literally:

```bash
export GMXDATA="/opt/miniconda3/envs/biochar/share/gromacs"
export PATH="/opt/miniconda3/envs/biochar/bin:$PATH"
```

**The commit gate is `tools/hooks/pre-commit`**, installed by `bash tools/hooks/install.sh`. It runs
secrets, ruff, the fast tier, and `rq index`. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`; CI still runs
everything.

`.claude/settings.json` carries permissions only. It used to hold a `PreToolUse` hook that ran the
full suite before commits; it was removed because it did not do that. Its `matcher` was `"Bash"` —
every command — and the `"if": "Bash(git commit*)"` that was meant to narrow it is not part of the
hook schema, so it was ignored. The result was the whole suite, unfiltered by the `slow` marker,
in front of arbitrary shell commands, against a 600s timeout it could not meet. If you want a
gate, `tools/hooks/pre-commit` above is it.

## Architecture

The package lives entirely in `src/biochar/` (src layout — the package is importable only when
installed, so a test run cannot silently exercise the working tree instead of the installed package).
After moving branches or a fresh clone, run `pip install -e ".[dev,ml]"` or imports will fail.

**`pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for what is public.** `[project.scripts]` declares the four console
entry points; `src/biochar/__init__.py`'s `__all__` declares the public Python API. Do not infer the public surface
from this file — check those two.

| Console script | Module | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `biochar-gen` | `cli/cli.py` | Generate a single structure or series |
| `biochar-sweep` | `cli/sweep_cli.py` | Run a declarative factorial parameter sweep |
| `biochar-md-setup` | `cli/md_setup_cli.py` | Generate GROMACS run directories from a sweep manifest |
| `biochar-condense` | `cli/condensation_cli.py` | Set up a Wood et al. 2024 condensation-annealing run |

### Module map

The package is organised into subpackages (`pipeline/`, `charges/`, `export/`, `workflows/`,
`models/`, `cli/`) that follow the import graph, plus `constants.py` kept at the package root
since every subpackage imports it. Full layering detail lives in `rqm/ARCHITECTURE.md`; this is
a quick index.

`pipeline/biochar_generator.py` orchestrates the single-molecule pipeline (five steps, below).
Beyond that pipeline:

- **`workflows/sweep.py`** — declarative parameter-sweep driver; `run_sweep`, `expand_grid`,
  `build_point`, and the sweep manifest that `export/md_setup.py` consumes.
- **`export/md_setup.py`** — writes GROMACS run inputs (`.mdp` templates plus a driver script) per
  structure; `setup_md_from_manifest`, ion profiles, pre-solvation stages.
- **`workflows/condensation.py`** — Wood et al. 2024 condensation-annealing setup (parallel
  construction mode).
- **`models/temperature_model.py`** — data-driven temperature × feedstock property model;
  `TemperatureModel`, `properties`, `VALID_FEEDSTOCKS`.
- **`charges/qm_charges.py`** — LigParGen-style QM partial charges (1.14*CM1A) via an external
  MOPAC binary. Requires a MOPAC install; raises `QMChargeError` when unavailable.
- **`charges/ml_charges.py`** — ML-based partial charge refinement.
- **`pipeline/valence.py`** — valence validation system (see `docs/guides/VALENCE_SYSTEM.md`).
- **`cli/cli.py`**, **`cli/sweep_cli.py`**, **`cli/md_setup_cli.py`**, **`cli/condensation_cli.py`**
  — argument parsing only; the logic lives in the module each one wraps.

### Generation pipeline (single molecule)

`BiocharGenerator.generate()` runs five sequential steps, each in its own module under `pipeline/`:

1. **`carbon_skeleton.py`** — `PAHAssembler` builds a PAH graph. For targets ≤40 C it picks an exact SMILES from `PAH_LIBRARY` (in `constants.py`). For larger targets it selects the closest library seed then iteratively fuses rings (hexagons or pentagons controlled by `defect_fraction`) until the carbon count is within tolerance. A custom hex-lattice position tracker keeps all coordinates consistent so `geometry_3d` receives a flat, strain-free sheet.

2. **`heteroatom_assignment.py`** — `OxygenAssigner` places functional groups (phenolic, carboxyl, ether, etc.) either from an explicit dict or derived from `O_C_ratio`. `HydrogenAssigner` then fills remaining free valences. A critical function `_fix_heteroatom_bond_types` (also called in `biochar_generator.py` after geometry and after validation) corrects RDKit's tendency to mark ether C–O bonds as `AROMATIC` during sanitisation.

3. **`geometry_3d.py`** — `CoordinateGenerator` embeds in 3D. Molecules ≤80 heavy atoms use RDKit ETKDGv3/v2 + MMFF94; larger molecules use the pre-computed hex-lattice 2D coords. When `generator.used_hex_lattice` is `True`, clash resolution is **skipped** because peri-H contacts in large fused PAHs are real geometry, not errors — displacing atoms would shatter the ring lattice.

4. **`opls_typing.py`** — `AtomTyper` maps each atom to an internal OPLS-AA type (CA, HA, OH, OS, …). At export time `GROMACS_OPLS_TYPE_MAP` in `constants.py` translates these to GROMACS `opls_XXX` names.

5. **`validation.py`** — `ValidationEngine` checks composition ratios and geometry. Steric clash warnings from the flat hex-lattice path are expected and do not indicate a bug.

### Surface pipeline

`generate_surface()` → `SurfaceBuilder` (`workflows/surface_builder.py`). Generates each sheet through the single-molecule pipeline, flattens to the xy plane (SVD best-fit rotation), then stacks along z with spacing `pore_diameter + 3.4 Å` (graphene interlayer distance). Identical sheets are generated once and deep-copied. The combined `.gro` has all sheets as separate residues; `.top` references one `.itp` (identical sheets) or one `.itp` per unique sheet type.

### GROMACS export

`export/gromacs_export.py` contains three writers: `GROFileWriter`, `ITPFileWriter`, `TOPFileWriter`, orchestrated by `GromacsExporter`. Coordinates are converted from RDKit Å → GROMACS nm (× 0.1). Residue names are hard-limited to 5 characters by GROMACS `.gro` format.

### Key constraints

- `molecule_name` / residue name: **≤5 characters** (GROMACS hard limit).
- Carbonyl, quinone, and lactone functional groups fall back silently to phenolic — pure aromatic PAH edges have no free valence for these.
- `_fix_heteroatom_bond_types` must be called after any RDKit `SanitizeMol` pass that touches a molecule containing ether oxygens.
- The hex-lattice path (large molecules) produces geometrically perfect structures; clash warnings from `GeometryValidator` on these are artefacts and should be ignored — GROMACS energy minimisation resolves them.
